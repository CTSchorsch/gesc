Version 5
---------
|--- Wrong JLC order Number for :
| |--- 56k (5k6 is soldered)
| |--- 22R1 (220R is soldered)
| |--- 680k (6k80 is soldered)
|
|--- Missing I2C1 Pull-Ups
|--- 1mOhm Shunt is too much for Motor Current > 30A. Change to 0.5mOhm or use INA240A1


Version 4 25.5.2020
-------------------

|---  ICU for servo detection and ENC Input uses the same time TIM3
| |--- Interrupt sharing ?
  |--- DONE, change HW Pins for next Version
|
|---  Remove planes under BLE antenna DONE
|---  EXT off needs FET. Hall sensor is 32V max DONE

Layout is very noisy with motor current > 30A
-> Redesign
INA away from power stage
bigger traces for gate driver
more local caps
no signal plane beteween gnd and vbat
split gnd plane
